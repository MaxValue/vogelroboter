# VÃ¶gelroboter

The bird quiz robot. You see a picture and three names of birds. If you pick right you get
part of a cocktail. But only a small part. Complete four identifications for a full drink.

The list of bird images and the list of possible answers are in easy text files, so this can 
be easily modified to do other quizes.

The code uses the HelloDrinkbot code for the liquid dispensing, and can be easily modified to 
dispense additional ingredients. 

[See the quiz directory README.md to run the quiz](quiz/README.md)

## Electronics

- Raspberry pi
- Motor hat
- two peristaltic pumps
- 12 volt power for pumps
- 5 volt power for Raspberry Pi

## Sounds? (a stretch goal!)

- The raspberry pi has an audio output. If you add speakers the bot could
  play bird songs. See examples of playing sounds  in the [Bender bot](../bender/README.md)
