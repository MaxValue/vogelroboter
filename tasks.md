## GOAL! To get the robot shipped with workable (even if ugly) code.

done - set up robot, kb, mouse in office
done - why am I not on the network?
because /etc/dhcpcd.conf - had static address
done - git pull - had to regenerate keys and do a bunch of silliness, but it worked eventually
done - upgrade everything so that I can get flask to run
done - run app
done - add dispensing to quiz
done - add 'used' list to not reuse a bird unless/until a new user. Or maybe, until all birds have been used.

done - - set/test amounts dispensed
done - take pi and pumps out of existing robot 
done - pump 0 does not work. Pump 2 works in quiz and pump_test.py
  my daisy chained abortion of a ground wire was at fault.

done - Make new crimps for ground and signal wires. Don't daisy chain the 
  grounds. Two ground wires, connected to two ground terminals on the 
  motor hat. Tape over or rewire the ground wires.  Possibly longer 
  wires for the pumps

done - test again. check pump #s in code.

done - What should it do for network? I think you need to click on the network tab and connect


done - find clean tubing, wash it
done - add documents to the README on getting code to run,
- done add requirements.txt
done - vogel - change the root password
- logout from github in web
- copy pi image
done - add fun desktop photo
- later, remove ssh key for robot from my github

done - Take pictures and document the pi, hat, and motors, in case wires come loose

- weigh the package

- find bubble wrap, and pack in it, probably a envelope or box from Post Office
