## GOAL! To get the robot shipped with workable (even if ugly) code.

done - set up robot, kb, mouse in office
done - why am I not on the network?
because /etc/dhcpcd.conf - had static address
done - git pull - had to regenerate keys and do a bunch of silliness, but it worked eventually
done - upgrade everything so that I can get flask to run
done - run app
done - add dispensing to quiz
done - add 'used' list to not reuse a bird unless/until a new user. Or maybe, until all birds have been used.

done - - set/test amounts dispensed
done - take pi and pumps out of existing robot 
done - pump 0 does not work. Pump 2 works in quiz and pump_test.py
  my daisy chained abortion of a ground wire was at fault.

- Make new crimps for ground and signal wires. Don't daisy chain the 
  grounds. Two ground wires, connected to two ground terminals on the 
  motor hat.

- test again. check pump #s in code.

- tape over or rewire the ground wires.
- possibly longer wires for the pumps
- What should it do for network? I think you need to click on the network tab and connect
- remove my keys from .ssh
- remove my keyboard usb dongle before shipping.
- find clean tubing, wash it
- add documents to the README on getting code to run,
- done add requirements.txt
- change the root password
- logout from github in web
- add fun desktop photo
- later, remove ssh key for robot from my github

- Take pictures and document the pi, hat, and motors, in case wires come loose
- screen shot the network selection
- weigh the package

- find bubble wrap, and pack in it, probably a envelope or box from Post Office
- pi and hat
- 2 pumps, wired
- 5 and 12 V power?
- all screws/mounting hardware

- confirm that Sandra can get a monitor, kb, mouse
